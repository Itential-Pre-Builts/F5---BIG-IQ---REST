# Overview 

This contains modular workflows that operate when integrated with F5 BIG-IQ. Once installed teams will be able to quickly automate common manual tasks like software upgrade of managed BIG-IP devices, saving a significant amount of time and effort. This library can be used as modular components with other libraries and automations to build comprehensive end-to-end orchestrated workflows with Itential's low-code platform.
